The cleaning part mainly focuses on : 
1. dealing with null values
2. Removing outliers
   - Use the iqr method which is a statistical method
   - Dropping outliers where the effect seems to be not much impactful
3.Feature Engineering : Many features have been extracted too.
4. Applying the log transformation ti avoid dealing with negative values
5. Basic data cleaning
   - Cleaning of formats
   - Transformation
6. Using the group by and pivot table methods(additional part)
7. Now as the data is good to go for visualisation steps but visualisation could be used beforehand so as to find the outliers , see the skewness in the data
8. I still have covered every possible way to look for faulty data via cleaning step and not visualization.
9. WHAT IS MISSING : Encoding could've been done for various features cause the data is mostly categorical .
